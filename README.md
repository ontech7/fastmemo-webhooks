## FAQs

### Why?

This sample project/boilerplate is to demonstrate how to integrate webhooks with [Fast Memo](https://www.fastmemo.app/) mobile app on a Next.js project.

### How does 'in-real-time' fetching work?

I used Socket.IO library to make client and server connections (using API Routes).

### Can I use this with App Routes?

Sure, but the server must stay in the API Routes under `/pages`. All the other things can be moved to `/app`.
